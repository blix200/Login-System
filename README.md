# Instructions

**Firstly You Want To Make A Github File Name It "Logs" And That Is Where The Login Info Will Go So for the login info it can be anything you want (Besides The ClientID), But you must follow this format: *Username:Password:ClientID* In order to get the ClientID you must run this:**

*local clientId = game:GetService("RbxAnalyticsService"):GetClientId()*

*setclipboard(clientId)*

*print("Client ID (HWID) copied to clipboard: " .. clientId)*

Once you have that you want to Replace the "ClientID" Part with the clientid copied to clipboard. If You have clients and someone bought your script and you want to license them, ask them to execute that script and send the outputted Info.

**Now Heres an example Login Information: Glaze123:SuperSecurePassword123:2020202020**

**Now You Should Copy the Login Script Code, And Goto Line: 101 OR "local LOGIN_URL" Now you should replace that link with the RAW Github file you made. (Logs file) Next Goto: Line 138 And replace it with your Scripts Source code The Script is now finished, Open A issue If there is a problem.**
